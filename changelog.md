#### v0.0.2

- Fix: clientOid duplication in `multi_order`
- Fix: Incorrect variable access in `order`
- Update: Explicit for loop (3) left in the code for some reason, in `single_order` and `multi_order`
- Update: Rename `single_order` and `multi_order` to `_single_order` and `_multi_order` respectively to make it clear it's meant for internal use.
